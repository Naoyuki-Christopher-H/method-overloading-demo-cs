# Method Overloading Demo in C\#

This repository demonstrates **method overloading** in C#, a feature that allows multiple methods to share the same name but differ in the number or type of parameters.

## Overview

The concept of method overloading is illustrated through a simple `Multiply` method with three different versions:

1. **Multiply(double, double)** - Multiplies two double values
2. **Multiply(int, int)** - Multiplies two integer values
3. **Multiply(double)** - Squares a single double value

Each version has a unique **method signature**, which is a combination of the method name and parameter types. This allows the compiler to distinguish between them.

## Example Output

When the program is run, it produces output like:

```
Multiply(2.5, 3.5) = 8.75
Multiply(2, 3) = 6
Multiply(5.0) = 25
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naoyuki-Christopher-H/method-overloading-demo-cs.git
   ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.

3. Build and run the project.
